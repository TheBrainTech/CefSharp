Instructions to create Nuget Packages for CefSharp after custom changes.

1) Build the project in release mode for both x86 and x64
2) Download Nuget.exe to create nuget packages
3) From commandline go to the location of nuget and use command : nuget pack <path to nuspec file which are in cefsharp "Nuget" folder> \<version>

Most probably you will only need Cefsharp.Common and Cefsharp.wpf. Make sure to specify cef versions in cefsharp.common nuget.
Also make sure to use the newly built browsersubprocess.exe

Put the nuget packages in Brain Box Engineering-> Nuget folder for everyone to access from.
Also, copy the packages to TheBrainNet->NugetLocal foolder as this is the source set in nuget.config of the project.
